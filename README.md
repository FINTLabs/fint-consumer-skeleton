# FINT Consumer Skeleton

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FINTprosjektet/fint-consumer-skeleton.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FINTprosjektet/fint-consumer-skeleton)

## Setup

The `SubscriberService` is added to the project to receive events.  
Custom code should be added in this class (or replaced by a new implementation) to alter the logic when new events are received.
